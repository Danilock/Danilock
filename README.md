# Hi Everyone, It's Dani Here!🕹🎮

#### Games had a big impact in my life ❤ and that's why I decided to become a Game Programmer.
#### With two years of experience working with Unity, I've been capable to make games to share
#### histories with the gaming community. And most important, developed tools to help artists to
#### make their dreams real!!! 

# Projects
## Trenia
I'm currently developing [Trenia](https://github.com/Danilock/Sci-Fy), a 2D Speed Running platformer inspired by [Aeon Drive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252240/Aeon_Drive/) where you are in the skin of Ragnarov.
> This is an Open Project and everyone can contribute!


<H2 aling = "center"> Swords </H2>
It's other of my platformer games(**Yes, I love platformers**) where you use a Red Riding Hood as main character... beat enemies and reach the goal in this short little game.
The development process of this game was absolutly fun. I worked on the whole gameplay and UI systems, it still **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** and eveyone can contribute!

#Interests
[center]Beside programming and videogames, I spend my time playing Soccer ⚽ and talking to cats 😺!
