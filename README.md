# Hi Everyone, It's Dani Here 🕹🎮

#### Games had a big impact in my life ❤ and that's why I decided to become a Game Programmer.
#### With two years of experience working with Unity, I've been capable to make games to share
#### histories with the gaming community. And most important, developed tools to help artists to
#### make their dreams real!!! 

#Projects
I'm currently developing [Trenia](https://github.com/Daniloc/Sci-Fy), a 2D Speed Running platformer inspired by [Aeon Drive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252240/Aeon_Drive/) where you are in the skin of Ragnarov.
> This is an Open Project and everyone can contribute!
